**My SQL Installation Below** 

**Windows 10 -**

Start by downloading the MySQL Web Installer from the [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919) page. (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.)

Follow along with the installer:

1) Click "Yes" if prompted to update.
2) Accept license terms.
3) Choose Custom setup type.
4) When prompted to Select Products and Features, choose the following:
* MySQL Server 8.0.19 (This will be under "MySQL Servers > MySQL Server > MySQL Server 8.0")

* MySQL Workbench 8.0.19 (This will be under "Applications > MySQL Workbench > MySQL Workbench 8.0")

5) Select "Next", then "Execute". Wait for download and installation. (This can take a few minutes.)

6) Advance through Configuration as follows:

* High Availability set to "Standalone".

* "Defaults are OK" under Type and Networking.

* Authentication Method set to Use Legacy Authentication Method.

* Set password to something you will remember. 

* Defaults are OK under Windows Service. Make sure that checkboxes are checked for the options "Configure MySQL Server as a Windows Service" and "Start the MySQL Server at System Startup". Under Run Windows Service as..., the "Standard System Account" should be selected.

7) Complete Installation process.
Next, add the MySQL environment variable to the System PATH. We must include MySQL in the System Environment Path Variable. This is its own multi-step process:

8) Open the Control Panel and visit System and "Security > System". Select "Change Settings" and a pop-up window will display. Select the tab "Advanced" and select the "Environment Variables" button.
9) Within the System Variables navigator window, select PATH..., click Edit..., and then New.

10) Add the exact location of your MySQL installation, and click OK. (This location is likely C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin, but may differ depending on your specific installation.)

**MacOS -**

Start by downloading the MySQL Community Server .dmg file from the [MySQL Community Server page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914). Click the download icon. Use the No thanks, just start my download link.

Next, follow along with the Installer until you reach the Configuration page. Once you've reached Configuration, select or set the following options (use default if not specified):

1) Use Legacy Password Encryption.

2) Set password to something you will remember.

3) Click Finish.

4) Open the terminal and enter the command echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile. This will save this path in .bash_profile, which is where our terminal is configured.

5) Type in source ~/.bash_profile (or restart the terminal) in order to actually verify that MySQL was installed.

Next, verify MySQL installation by opening terminal and entering the command mysql -uroot -pepicodus. You'll know it's working and connected if you gain access and see the MySQL command line. If it's not working, you'll likely get a -bash: mysql: command not found error.

You can exit the mysql program by entering exit.

Next, download the MySQL Workbench .dmg file from the MySQL Workbench page. (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.)

Install MySQL Workbench to Applications folder.

Then open MySQL Workbench and select the Local instance 3306 server. You will need to enter the password you set. (We used epicodus.) If it connects, you're all set.

**Install Postman**
This is optional https://www.postman.com/downloads/ 


**Setup Database Connection**

Create a new file in the root directory of the __BusinessLookup.Solution/ directory named "appsettings.json".  Copy and past the following code inside of the file.

```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=bizlookup;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}

```
Replace "YourId" and "YourPassword" in the code above with the user id and user password you use for logging into MySQL Workbench.  Save the "appsettings.json" file.

Navigate to `BizLookupMvc` directory and type the following code and hit enter/return to install the necessary dependencies.
