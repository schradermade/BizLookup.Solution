# üìÇ Setup and Use

### Download Project from Github

1. Open your terminal and navigate to a directory that you wish to download this project to.
2. Type the following line of code into your terminal, and press 'Enter'. Project will automatically begin downloading to your current directory.

    <code>git clone https://github.com/schradermade/BizLookup.Solution.git</code>
3. Once the project has finished downloading, use the terminal to navigate to the ‚Äú__BizLookup.Solution__" folder of the project.
4. Now, navigate to __BizLookupMvc__ directory and run these commands:
    - `dotnet restore`
    - `dotnet run`


### Database Setup

1. In the __BusinessLookup.Solution/__ directory, create a new file and name it "appsettings.json".  Copy and paste the following code into your new appsettings.json file.

2. Code to paste into __appsettings.json__
```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=bizlookup;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```
3. Also in `appsettings.json`: In the above block of code, within the `"DefaultConnection"`, you will need to change the `uid` and `pwd` to the corresponding UserName and Password you set for your MySQL WorkBench.

4. Save the `appsettings.json` file.
5. In the terminal, navigate to the `BizLookupApi` folder inside of the `BizLookup.Solution` directory, and run these commands:
    - `dotnet ef database update`
    - Optional step: To update the database with any changes to the code, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationsName>` which will use Entity Framework Core's code-first principle to generate a database update. After, run the previous command `dotnet ef database update` to update the database.
